___________________________________________________________
Compositional Proposal Testlist
___________________________________________________________
//Unit Testing
[48-49]- refactor AlphaCiv to use a AlphaCiv Aging strategy
    [49] - Game should age 100 years each round

//Unit Testing
[50-57] - handle aging structure for BetaCiv
    [50] - Game should age 100 years between 4000 and 100 BC
    [51] - Game should age 99 years between 100 and 1 BC
    [52] - Game should age 2 between 1 BC and 1 AD
    [53] - Game should age 49 between 1 and 50 AD
    [54] - Game should age 50 between 50 and 1750 AD
    [55] - Game should age 25 between 1750 and 1900 AD
    [56] - Game should age 5 between 1900 and 1970 AD
    [57] - Game should age 1 from 1970 AD and beyond

//Integration Testing
[58] - Refactor AlphaCiv to use AlphaCiv winner strategy
[60] - When a player conqures all cities, he should win the game for betaStrategy
[61] - Refactor alphaCiv to use AlphaCiv unit action strategy (Does nothing)
[62] - Settlers action produces a city on it's position. (GammaCiv)
[63] - Settlers are removed from the game when they have performed their action. (GammaCiv)
[65] - Archers defensive streangth is doubled when their action is performed (GammaCiv)
[66] - Archers cannot move when their action has been performed (GammaCiv)
[67] - Archers can now move again, when their action performed is used again (GammaCiv)
[68] - Refactor Alhphaciv to use AlphaCiv World Layout strategy
[69-71] - When world layout is created, it should reflect figure 36.1 from the book, there should be a red city at (8,12) and a blue city at (4,5)
        and it should be easy for programmers to change the world layout without changing source code - For DeltaCiv.
    [69] - should have red City at 8,12 (DeltaCiv)
    [70] - should have blue City at 4,5 (DeltaCiv)
    [71] - Tiles should represent figure 36.1 image from the book (DeltaCiv)
[72] - Refactor AlphaCiv to use AlphaCiv Attacking Strategy
    [73] - Should return 3 as defensive Strength
    [74] - Should return 0 as attacking strength
    [75] - The attacker wins any combat no matter attacking- and defensive strength.
[76] - Refactor alphaciv to use attacking strategy (Necessary for EpsilonCiv)

##### For EpsilonCiv
[] - Archer should have 2 attack strength
[] - Archer should have 3 defence strength
[] - Legion should have 2 defence strength
[] - Legion should have 4 attack strength
[] - Settler should have 0 attack strength
[] - Settler should have 3 defence strength
[] - Units attacking strength (including strength gained by team-units) should be multiplied by the dice roll
[] - Defenders defence strength (including strength gained by team-units) should be multiplied by the dice roll
[] - player's unit gets boosted defence by 1 by every team unit that surrounds the player's unit
[] - player's unit gets boosted attack by 1 by every team unit that surrounds the player's unit
##Different combat scenarios for epsilonCiv
[] - A settler with 4 team archers surrounding win an attack against other players archer which has no surroundings.
Fixed dice for settler: 6. Fixed for archer: 1.
[] -
[] -
[] -
[] -
[] -
[] - When a blue legion placed in a blue town surrounded by two friendly archers and the legion attacks a red archer,
who is in reach of the legion and is surrounded by 1 friendly archer. The legion is boosted by a dice of 3 and the archer
is boosted by a dice of 3. Legion should win.
